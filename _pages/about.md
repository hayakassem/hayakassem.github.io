## Biography

Hello, I’m **Haya Kassem**, a multidisciplinary researcher and data scientist committed to harnessing emerging technologies for social good. My academic and professional journey centres on exploring the intersection of technology, society, and ethics, with a focus on data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and their broader societal impacts.

With a **Distinction-awarded MSc in Big Data and Digital Futures** from the University of Warwick, I’ve developed advanced technical skills in Python, R, and SQL, alongside a critical understanding of the ethical and methodological challenges posed by generative AI and large-scale data ecosystems. My final portfolio was recognised as exemplary work, selected for use in promotional materials by Warwick.

Currently, I work as an **AI Evaluator**, where I assess large language models (LLMs) for bias, inaccuracies, and user relevance. My professional journey also includes roles in financial risk assessment, data analysis, and policy research, where I have collaborated with diverse teams and senior stakeholders on high-impact projects.

Beyond technical expertise, I am passionate about **creating equitable spaces within technology and academia**. As the Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Representative for my department, I led initiatives to decolonise the curriculum and foster inclusivity in data science programmes, earning recognition for collaborative workshops and actionable solutions.

I also conduct research on pressing global challenges such as climate justice, migration policy, and systemic digital inequalities, integrating theoretical frameworks with varied research methodologies.
