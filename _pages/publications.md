## My Past Research 


### 2024

- **[Colonial Platform Gaslighting: Meta’s Automated Silencing of Palestinian Narratives](../assets/papers/Colonial Platform Gaslighting- Meta’s Automated Silencing of Palestinian Narratives.pdf)**  
  *This study explores the systemic bias in Meta's content moderation algorithms, analysing their role in silencing Palestinian voices. Through a critical exploration and the introduction of "Colonial Platform Gaslighting," the paper highlights how automated moderation practices disproportionately suppress Palestinian narratives, perpetuating colonial hierarchies within the digital realm. Recommendations include algorithmic transparency and equitable content policies to rectify these inequities.*

- **[Inequality at Scale: Unpacking the Causes and Consequences of Instagram’s Network Distribution](../assets/papers/Inequality at Scale, Unpacking the causes and consequences of Instagram’s Network Distribution.pdf)**  
  *This paper investigates Instagram's network algorithms and their role in amplifying social inequalities. It introduces the concept of "privilege-based attachment" to explain how algorithmic systems reinforce existing hierarchies. The findings critique the platform’s commercial motives, emphasising the need for ethical algorithmic design to foster fairer digital ecosystems.*

- **[Privacy, Pornography, and AI: A Multidisciplinary Exploration of Deepfakes](../assets/papers/Privacy, Pornography, and AI A Multidisciplinary Exploration of Deepfakes.pdf)**  
  *The paper examines the ethical, legal, and social challenges posed by AI-generated deepfakes, with a focus on non-consensual pornography. It argues for comprehensive policy frameworks to address privacy violations and mitigate harm while balancing technological advancement with ethical considerations.*

- **[What Role Do Algorithms Play in Shaping What We Know of the World?](../assets/papers/What role do algorithms play in shaping what we know of the world.pdf)**  
  *This essay delves into the influence of algorithms on public knowledge, arguing that they actively construct societal understanding by amplifying dominant narratives and erasing marginalised voices. Using feminist epistemology and critical race theory, it critiques algorithmic biases and their broader implications for knowledge production.*


### 2023

- **[Determining the Convergence of Climate Ethics Principles Using an Interdisciplinary Approach](../assets/papers/Determining the Convergence of Climate Ethics Principles Using an Interdisciplinary Approach.pdf)**  
  *This research analyses the intersections of ethical principles—Ability to Pay, Polluter Pays, and Beneficiary Pays—within climate justice. Using interdisciplinary methods, it critiques conventional climate responsibility frameworks and advocates for historically contextualised approaches.*

- **[Climate Ethics: An Interdisciplinary Exploration](../assets/papers/Climate Ethics- An Interdisciplinary Exploration.pdf)**  
  *This paper offers a multidisciplinary critique of global climate justice, highlighting the role of capitalist structures in perpetuating inequalities. It calls for accountability frameworks that transcend state-centric models to address injustices like green colonialism and inter-state disparities.*

- **[Are There Decisive Moral Objections to the Premeditated and Officially Authorised Killing of Terrorist Suspects by Military or Intelligence Officials?](../assets/papers/Are there decisive moral objections to the premeditated and officially authorised killing of terrorist suspects by military or intelligence officials.pdf)**  
  *This paper challenges the ethical justifications for targeted killings, using moral philosophy to critique the dehumanisation and denial of fundamental rights. It argues for stricter ethical frameworks in counterterrorism to uphold human dignity.*

- **[Evaluate the Effectiveness of Palestinian Armed Resistance Versus Non-Violent Resistance in Terms of Achieving the Goal of Self-Determination](../assets/papers/Evaluate the effectiveness of Palestinian armed resistance versus non-violent resistance in terms of achieving the goal of self-determination.pdf)**  
  *The paper compares armed and non-violent resistance strategies within the Palestinian struggle. It argues that non-violent approaches, amplified by digital advocacy, are more inclusive and globally resonant, offering a pathway to achieving self-determination.*

- **[To What Extent Are the West’s Selective Borders Instruments of Inequality, and What Are Their Implications for Human Rights?](../assets/papers/To what extent are the West's selective borders instruments of inequality, and what are their implications for human rights.pdf)**  
  *This dissertation examines the racial, economic, and legal dimensions of Western border policies, arguing that selective borders perpetuate postcolonial inequalities. Using case studies of Ukrainian and Syrian refugees, it critiques the unequal treatment inherent in these policies.*

- **[Select a Recent Protest: Explain What Role Inequality Played in It](../assets/papers/Select a recent protest, Explain what role inequality played in it.pdf)**  
  *This paper analyses Egypt's Tahrir Square protests, attributing their mobilisation to systemic vertical inequalities. By employing grievance theory, it reveals how disparities in wealth and opportunity fuelled solidarity across class lines, shaping the collective identity of the protestors.*

- **[Is It Excessively Charitable to Describe Terrorists as Rational Agents?](../assets/papers/Is it excessively charitable to describe terrorists as rational agents.pdf)**  
  *This philosophical analysis argues that terrorists can be rational agents, employing a virtue-theoretic framework to evaluate their decision-making processes. It challenges simplistic stereotypes by highlighting the role of context in shaping rationality.*


### 2022

- **[Are We Morally Responsible for Our Implicit Biases?](../assets/papers/Are we morally responsible for our implicit biases.pdf)**  
  *This paper argues for moral accountability in implicit biases, positing that individuals have the capacity to recognise and mitigate biases over time. Using a virtue ethics approach, it critiques the notion that implicit biases are beyond individual control.*

- **[Is Virtue Ethics a Self-Effacing Theory?](../assets/papers/Is virtue ethics a self-effacing theory.pdf)**  
  *This philosophical exploration defends virtue ethics against claims of self-effacement by demonstrating how its focus on agent flourishing aligns with moral motivations. It resolves key objections by highlighting the compatibility of virtuous living with self-interest.*
