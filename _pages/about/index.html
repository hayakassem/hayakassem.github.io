My academic and professional journey centres on exploring the intersection of technology, society, and ethics, with a focus on data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and their broader societal impacts.</p> <p>With a <strong>Distinction-awarded MSc in Big Data and Digital Futures</strong> from the University of Warwick, I’ve developed advanced technical skills in Python, R, and SQL, alongside a critical understanding of the ethical and methodological challenges posed by generative AI and large-scale data ecosystems. My final portfolio was recognised as exemplary work, selected for use in promotional materials by Warwick.</p> <p>Currently, I work as an <strong>AI Evaluator</strong>, where I assess large language models (LLMs) for bias, inaccuracies, and user relevance. My professional journey also includes roles in financial risk assessment, data analysis, and policy research, where I have collaborated with diverse teams and senior stakeholders on high-impact projects.</p> <p>Beyond technical expertise, I am passionate about <strong>creating equitable spaces within technology and academia</strong>. As the Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Representative for my department, I led initiatives to decolonise the curriculum and foster inclusivity in data science programmes, earning recognition for collaborative workshops and actionable solutions.</p> <p>I also conduct research on pressing global challenges such as climate justice, migration policy, and systemic digital inequalities, integrating theoretical frameworks with varied research methodologies.</p> <hr> <h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Ethical Governance of Emerging Technologies and AI</strong>: Exploring bias, digital colonialism, and the societal implications of algorithmic decision-making.</li> <li> <strong>Climate Justice</strong>: Quantifying disparities in global emissions responsibility through advanced data analysis techniques.</li> <li> <strong>Digital Inequalities</strong>: Investigating systemic inequities in platform economies and social media networks using data mining and visualisation tools.</li> <li> <strong>Postcolonial Perspectives</strong>: Addressing migration policy and socio-economic inequalities through intersectional and data-driven approaches.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="awards-and-recognition">Awards and Recognition</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Award for Excellence</strong>: Best Overall Performance in MSc Big Data and Digital Futures (University of Warwick).</li> <li> <strong>CIM Bursary Recipient</strong>: For outstanding academic performance enabling postgraduate studies.</li> <li> <strong>Pearson Edexcel Outstanding Learners Award</strong>: Highest mark in Africa in IGCSE History.</li> <li> <strong>Outstanding Cambridge Learner Award</strong>: Highest mark in Alexandria in IGCSE English.</li> </ul> <hr> <h2 id="skills-and-expertise">Skills and Expertise</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Technical Proficiency</strong>: Advanced skills in Python, R, SQL, and cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure.
